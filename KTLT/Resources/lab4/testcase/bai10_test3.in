It's the most wonderful time of the year There'll be much mistltoeing And hearts will be glowing When loved ones are near It's the most wonderful time Yes the most wonderful time Oh the most wonderful time Of the year There'll be parties for hosting Marshmallows for toasting And caroling out in the snow There'll be scary ghost stories And tales of the glories of Christmases long long ago

It's Christmas time there's no need to be afraid At Christmas time we let in light and we banish shade And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy Throw your arms around the world at Christmas time But say a prayer Pray for the other ones At Christmas time it's hard but when you're having fun There's a world outside your window And it's a world of dread and fear Where the only water flowing
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time The greatest gift they'll get this year is life Where nothing ever grows No rain nor rivers flow Do they know it's Christmas time at all Here's to you Raise a glass for everyone Spare a thought this yuletide for the deprived If the table was turned would you survive
Christmas is most truly Christmas when we celebrate it by giving the light of love to those who need it most Some Christmas tree ornaments do more than glitter and glow they represent a gift of love given a long time ago Santa Claus is anyone who loves another and seeks to make them happy who gives himself by thought or word or deed in every gift that he bestows
Probably the reason we all go so haywire at Christmas time with the endless unrestrained and often silly buying of gifts is that we don’t quite know how to put our love into words I love the Christmas-tide and yet I notice this each year I live I always like the presents I get But how I love the presents I give
Let us have music for Christmas Sound the trumpet of joy and rebirth Let each of us try with a song in our hearts To bring peace to men on earth As for me I like to take my Christmas a little at a time all through the year Mankind is a great an immense family This is proved by what we feel in our hearts at Christmas
For Christmas is tradition time Traditions that recall The precious memories down the years The sameness of them all A good conscience is a continual Christmas God goes to those who have time to hear him—and so on this cloudless night he went to simple shepherds
I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need I don't care about the presents Underneath the Christmas tree I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you yeah I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need And I don't care about the presents Underneath the Christmas tree
Last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day you gave it away This year to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special Last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day you gave it away you gave it away This year to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special Once bitten and twice shy I keep my distance but you still catch my eye Tell me baby do you recognize me Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me
